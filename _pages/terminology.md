## Standard Terminology

###### LOINC â€“ Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes 
LOINC was developed and is maintained by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc, a non-profit medical research organization associated with Indiana University. The purpose of LOINC is to facilitate the exchange and pooling of clinical or laboratory results for clinical care, outcomes management, claims attachment, and research by providing a set of universal codes and names. LOINC codes allow users to merge clinical results from many sources into one database for patient care, clinical research, or management.

###### SNOMED CT
SNOMED CT is a clinical terminology and a required standard in interoperability specifications of the US Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. The terminology is owned and maintained by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), a not-for-profit association. NLM is the United States National Release Center for SNOMED CT.

###### RxNorm
RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including
those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.
